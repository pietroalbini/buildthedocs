=====================
Customize your builds
=====================

Even if the customizations BuildTheDocs applies to your documentation by
default are good, your project might need something more. For example, you
might want a way to fetch your source code different than the ones built-in, or
you might need to customize your build even further than the defaults.

BuildTheDocs is made to be extended, and this section explains you how to make
your documentation unique!
