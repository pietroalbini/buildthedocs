*A Sphinx documentation building tool on steroids.*

BuildTheDocs is a tool which helps building Sphinx_ documentation for multiple
versions of a project. It builds the documentation of multiple versions with
only one command, while customizing the documentation, for example adding a
simple version chooser.

Itâ€™s also licensed under the MIT license, allowing you to customize it as you
wish.

If you want to learn more about it, you should start reading the
